# theseus â›µ

A zero-knowledge proof-based Access Control List (ACL) system that enables historical validation through cryptographic succession proofs. theseus leverages bulletproofs for efficient range proofs and ed25519 for signature verification.

## The Ship of Identity

The name "Theseus" draws inspiration from the Ship of Theseus paradox - if you replace every part of a ship over time, is it still the same ship? This system provides a cryptographic answer to this question in the context of access control. Through zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic succession chains, the system maintains verifiable continuity of authorization even as administrative keys change over time.
